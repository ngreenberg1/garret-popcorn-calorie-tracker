    Program 1: Garrett's Popcorn Calorie Tracker
    The objective of this program is to determine the number of calories per a user will consume
    based on the number of cups of popcorn the user enters.  The nutritional facts state that there 
    are 150 calories (54 calories from fat) per 1 cup (30 grams) of Garrett's mixed popcorn.  You will 
    create a program that lets the user enter the number of cups of popcorn they ate and then report 
    the total number of calories consumed, total number of calories from fat, and the amount of popcorn 
    in grams consumed.
